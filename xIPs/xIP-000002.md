# Rationale
xDaiPunks has the goal to become a NFT project that is fully owned and managed by a DAO. The process to become a DAO will be a gradual one. To kick-start this process xDaiPunks will have to be a fully independent project with it's own unique Punks. 

This proposal is to adjust and improve the look and feel of our beloved Punks, while keeping their heritage alive. 

xDaiPunks is a project that lives on the xDai blockchain. As we have a strong bond with xDai, our Punks will need to reflect this. 

The proposal for design changes already received positive response from the community. And the term "Bit-Shifting" was already coined (pun). What is "Bit-Shifting"? Currently our Punks are png files of 24x24 pixels. The idea is to Bit-Shift that to a higher resolutution. By doing so, we can create higher resolution Punks with more detail and more depth. It also allows our Punks to receive a nice tattoo of the xDai logo. 

We want to make our Punks unique. Not only unique in the xDai ecosystem but also unique in the entire NFT ecosystem. 

# Requirements
- Punks will need to be unique while keeping their heritage alive
- Implementing Bit-Shifting
- Punks will stay pixelated and will be transparent PNG's
- 10.000 Unique Punks will need to be created. Having all types and attributes as overlays means image processesing can be utilized
