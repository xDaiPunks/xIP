# Rationale
This proposal is to adjust and improve the look and feel of our beloved Punks, while keeping their heritage alive.

xDaiPunks is a project that lives on the xDai blockchain. As we have a strong bond with xDai, our Punks reflect this.

The proposal for design changes already received positive response from the community. And the term "Bit-Shifting" was already coined (pun). What is "Bit-Shifting"? Currently our Punks are png files of 24x24 pixels. The idea was to Bit-Shift that to a higher resolutution. By doing so, we can create higher resolution Punks with more detail and more depth. We have  had the go-ahead of the community to create pixelated 3d xDaiPunks.

The xDaiPunks are now unique. Not only unique in the xDai ecosystem but also unique in the entire NFT ecosystem. The 3d Punks are generated from a master model that will contain all attributes, types and skin colors. This 3d model is an open-source model. With this model, Punks owners can generate 3d renders of their Punk and much more 

# Requirements
- The xDaiPunks need to be unique while keeping their heritage alive
- Implementing Bit-Shifting
- The xDaiPunks will stay pixelated
- The xDaiPunks will be 3d models. For marketplaces PNG's and SVG's will be generated from these models.
- 10.000 unique 3d xDaiPunks are being created. They will keep the same attributes and ranking as the 2d homage xDaiPunks.
- The 3d xDaiPunks will be the basis of our goverance token and will play an important role within our marketplace
# Status

The 3d model for the xDaiPunks is released
