# xDaiPunk Inprovement Proposal (xIP)



xDaiPunk Improvement Proposals (xIPs) describe standards for the xDaiPunk platform.

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the xIP-000001 process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed prior to opening a pull request.

This repository tracks the ongoing status of xIPs. It contains:

- Draft proposals where the author(s) are still making changes and is not ready for review.
- Review for proposals ready for xIP review process and the author(s) are ready for improvement suggestions.
- Last Call for proposals that may become final
- Accepted proposals which are awaiting implementation or deployment by Ethereum client developers.
- Final and [Living proposals that have solidified into a standard.
- The xIP that governs the xIP repository.

Achieving "Final" status in this repository only represents that a proposal has been reviewed for technical accuracy. It is solely the responsibility of the reader to decide whether a proposal will be useful to them.

## Project Goal

The xDaiPunk Improvement Proposals repository exists as a place to share concrete proposals with potential users of the proposal and the xDaiPunk community at large.
